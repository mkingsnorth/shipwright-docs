Features
========

* Create a wide range of objects just from a single number.
* Save set ups you like with the Presets feature.
* Dynamically change parameters and the objects will automatically update.
* Edit the objects using Blender's existing toolset.
* Customize the materials to suit your needs.
* Customize the shape with an editable lattice cage created around the object.
* All driven from one Panel based interface.
* Combine objects you already have with the new Levels System - not just generated ones.
* Export your object as a joined up Mesh with Smoothing and Baking options.
* Render out multiple variations with an 'Iterator' mode  (inspired by Chipp's idea for |KIT OPS SYNTH|)
* New Simpler installation - now no need for animation nodes.
