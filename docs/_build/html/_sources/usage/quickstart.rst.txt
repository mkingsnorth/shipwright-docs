Getting Started
######################

Once you have :ref:`installed<Installation>` the add-on, you can get started by :ref:`loading the main sample file<Load Main File>` or by :ref:`adding your own Shipwright object<Create a new object>`.  You can then :ref:`access the parameters<Accessing Parameters>` from the properties panel.

*************************
Load Main File
*************************

    .. image:: ../images/n-panel.jpg
       :alt: Shipwright Properties Panel


#. Load the **shipright.x.x.x.blend** file into Blender.
#. Make sure that the main object ('Shipwright') is selected.

There are :ref:`other files available<Sample Files>` in different configurations.

****************************************
Create a new object
****************************************

    .. image:: ../images/add_shipwright.jpg
       :width: 50%
       :alt: Shipwright Add Menu

You can alternatively create a new *Shipwright* object through the *Add* menu in Blender.  This menu is either accessible through the top of the 3D view or by pressing *Shift+A*.

****************************************
Accessing Parameters
****************************************

#. Access the "Shipwright" tab on the right hand side of the viewport by pressing the *n* key in the viewport.  This is the main panel that controls all the parameters for the object.
#. If the Shipwright object is selected, you should see all the parameters that make up the Shipwright object.  
#. Try changing one of these parameters, such as the **Master Seed** value. You should see the object change shape to a new random configuration.

See the :ref:`Parameters` section for more.
